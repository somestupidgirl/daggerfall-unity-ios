# Layout:
#
#	Builds/ios/		generated; safe to delete at any time (gitignored)
#	Builds/ios/proj/	Xcode project emitted by Unity (stage 1)
#	Builds/ios/app/		the .app built from it (stage 2)
#	Builds/ios/*.log	per-stage logs
#	Builds/ios/<bundle>.ipa	final signed archive (stage 3)

# The port is pinned to Unity 6 (6000.5.10f1) -- see ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt.
# Unity 2022.3.62f3's macOS-arm64 iOS build support shipped a Linux-baked IL2CPP
# Bee backend (HostPlatform.IsOSX=false) that hard-fails iOS builds, so we moved
# to Unity 6, whose iOS backend reports the correct macOS host.  UNITY defaults
# to the Hub-managed install of the pinned editor.

# --- App identity / signing -------------------------------------------
# PROJECT_NAME is the Unity product name -- it becomes the .app bundle and
# the .ipa leaf.  This repo is a FORK, so the Unity-emitted Xcode project
# carries the upstream author's (empty) signing identity.  We overrule it.
#
#   SIGN_IDENTITY  codesign identity.  Default "-" = AD-HOC signing, which
#                  needs no provisioning profile and no registered Apple ID
#                  account.  That sidesteps the headless "No Account for
#                  Team" failure entirely and yields a .ipa that sideloads
#                  on a dev/trusted device.
#
#   For a proper store/device install, provide a local Development identity
#   and team ID at invocation time or through an untracked local makefile:
#       bmake SIGN_IDENTITY=<local-identity> DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<local-team-id>
#
#   Find local identities with:
