# Engine patch inventory

The iOS port is a fork. Almost all of it lives in files upstream does not have
(`Assets/Scripts/Game/Mobile/`, `Assets/Editor/Mobile*`), which merge for free. This
document covers the exception: **15 upstream files we modify**, and what each change is
for. Keep it current — it is the difference between a routine rebase and an archaeology
session.

Measured against the port's first commit (`cc434d5e7`) as of v0.1.6-prealpha:
**16 files, roughly 455 lines added, 54 removed.** That is a small, tractable footprint for
a platform port, and worth defending.

## Ground rules that keep it small

1. **Prefer a new file in `Mobile/` over an engine edit.** Most of the port obeys this.
2. **Every engine edit is guarded** — `MobileInput.Enabled`, `MobileContentPath.Active`,
   or `#if UNITY_IOS && !UNITY_EDITOR` — so desktop behaviour is bit-identical and an
   upstream user of this fork loses nothing.
3. **Every edit carries a comment saying it is not upstream** and why. Grep for
   `MOBILE` / `EXPERIMENT` / `not upstream` to find them all.
4. **No reformatting, no drive-by cleanups** in engine files. Diff noise is what makes
   rebases expensive.

## The patches

### Input — `Assets/Scripts/Game/InputManager.cs` (+77, 12 hunks)
The largest patch, and the most load-bearing. Call-outs into the mobile layer at the
points where the engine collects input: `PollCursorStage()` before the paused
early-return (so menus work while the game is paused) and `PollGameplayStage()` after the
vanilla mouse axes are read. Also the touch-device branches that keep the engine's own
mouse path from fighting the touch layer.
*Rebase risk: HIGH.* Upstream touches InputManager often. If hunks conflict, re-anchor on
the same semantic points rather than line numbers.

### Classic HUD — `Assets/Scripts/Game/UserInterface/HUDLarge.cs` (+41, 2 hunks)
`IsLargeHUDInteractable()` passes on mobile when unpaused (the desktop `cursorActive`
gate makes every bar icon dead on a touchscreen), plus a new `TriggerTap()` that
hit-tests the eleven interactive panels so the touch layer can fire them.
*Rebase risk: LOW.* Self-contained; new method plus one early-return.

### Loose content paths — `AssetInjection/` (6 files, +265, 26 hunks)
`TextureReplacement`, `SoundReplacement`, `BookReplacement`, `VideoReplacement`,
`TextAssetReader`, `WorldDataReplacement`. All the same shape: read sites go through
`MobileContentPath.Override()` so a player copy under Documents wins, falling back to the
shipped file. Directory scans MERGE instead. Two are more than plumbing:
- **TextureReplacement** also forces `ARGB32` on iOS (DXT5 does not exist on iOS GPUs).
- **SoundReplacement** carries the whole WAV decoder and the ogg preload path (+212 alone),
  because the legacy `WWW("file://")` route returns empty clips on iOS.
*Rebase risk: LOW-MEDIUM.* Mechanical, but spread across six files.

### Quests — `QuestMachine.cs` (+7), `QuestListsManager.cs` (+21)
Quest sources and quest packs resolve from Documents first, then the 265 shipped quests.
Additive by necessity: a straight redirect would leave the game with no quests.
*Rebase risk: LOW.*

### Mods — `ModManager.cs` (+11, +45), `ModSupport/Editor/CreateModEditorWindow.cs` (+10)
`ModDirectory` points at Documents on iOS (the shipped folder is read-only, so the mod
system was enabled but permanently empty), and the mod builder gains an iOS build target,
off by default. 2026-09-01: `FindModsFromDirectory` scans BOTH Documents/Mods and the
shipped `StreamingAssets/Mods` on iOS (`MobileContentPath.Active`), merged by
`MergeModFiles` with the player's copy winning by file name - so bundled `.dfmod` files can
ship inside the app. Off iOS the two roots are the same folder and nothing changes.
*Rebase risk: LOW.*

### Billboards — `Internal/DaggerfallBillboard.cs` (+16)
`SetMaterial` returns null with one warning per archive when a flat's texture archive has no
such record, instead of throwing IndexOutOfRange from inside RDBLayout and aborting the
whole block - a mod block built against Daggerfall Expanded Textures blacked out
Privateer's Hold this way on device (2026-09-01). NOT platform-guarded on purpose: a
missing sprite beats a missing dungeon on desktop too, and nothing upstream relies on the
throw. *Rebase risk: LOW.* One guarded block after `GetMaterialAtlas`.

### Streaming world — `Terrain/StreamingWorld.cs` (+8)
`UpdateLocation()` refreshes `currentPlayerLocationObject` when it finishes building the
location for the player's own pixel. `UpdateLocations()` had looked it up in the same call
that STARTED the build coroutine, so for a freshly entered town the property stayed null
until the next pixel change - the journey pilot (and anything else asking whether the town
under the player exists) was told "no town" while standing in one. Correctness fix, not
guarded. *Rebase risk: LOW.* One block at the end of the coroutine.

### Input, journey hold — `InputManager.cs` (+1)
The journey's forward force is skipped while `MobileJourneyPilot.Holding` (the town under
the player is still being built). Part of the Input patch above.

### Lockpicking feedback — `Internal/DaggerfallActionDoor.cs` (+15)
`AttemptLockpicking()` returns silently when the player has already failed this door at
their current Lockpicking skill - correct vanilla rule, but on a touchscreen a mute door
is indistinguishable from a dead button, and it read as one in testing. Guarded by
`MobileInput.Enabled`, so desktop keeps the original silence. Uses the same
`PopupMessage` the success/failure paths use, with a reversion string because the text key
is not in the built StringTables yet (it IS in Internal_Strings.csv for a future import).
*Rebase risk: LOW.* One guarded block inside one method.

### UI plumbing — `DaggerfallUI.cs` (+3/-3), `BaseScreenComponent.cs` (+2/-1), `DaggerfallFont.cs` (+2/-2)
Small touch/scaling accommodations. Three lines each; check them by eye after a rebase
rather than trusting the merge.
*Rebase risk: LOW, but easy to lose silently — they are one-liners.*

## Rebase procedure

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity.git
    git fetch upstream master
    git checkout -b rebase-try ios-touch-port
    git rebase upstream/master

Then, in order:

1. **Resolve InputManager first.** It is the one that matters and the one most likely to
   conflict. Re-anchor on the semantic call sites, not line numbers.
2. **Run the self test** — `-executeMethod ...MobileSelfTest.RunAll`, 45 checks. It will
   not catch an input regression, but it catches broken maths and dead paths for free.
3. **Build for iOS.** The editor compile does NOT cover `#if UNITY_IOS` code, so a rebase
   can look clean and still have broken iOS-only branches. `BuildIOS` is the real check.
4. **Device-test the input paths by hand.** Nothing automated covers doors opening, the
   soft keyboard, or classic-bar taps, and all three have broken before.

## What a rebase cannot verify

The port's hardest-won knowledge is about device behaviour, not code: the iPadOS phantom
mouse/joystick pulses, dead UGUI pointer events, the 0.75s self-healing binding guard,
DXT5's absence, empty `WWW` audio clips. None of that is expressed as a test. If a rebase
changes behaviour in those areas it will look fine on the Mac and fail on the iPad — see
HANDOFF-controller.md for the full list before touching input or asset injection.
