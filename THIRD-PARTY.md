# Third-party notices

This repository is Daggerfall Unity (MIT, copyright (c) 2009-2023 Daggerfall Workshop - see
`LICENSE`) plus an iOS touch port (MIT, same terms). Two further MIT-licensed works are compiled
into the port rather than loaded as mods. Their original headers are preserved in the files named.

## Basic Roads

Copyright (c) 2020 Hazelnut. MIT License. https://github.com/ajrb/dfunity-mods
Contributors (per the original header): Hazelnut, and others credited there.

Used for: road, track, river and stream terrain texturing and the authored path data
(`Assets/Scripts/Game/Mobile/BasicRoadsTexturing.cs`, `Assets/Resources/BasicRoads/*.bytes`).
Modifications are listed in the file header. The author confirmed to the port's maintainer that
this use is welcome.

## Tedious Travel

Copyright (c) 2018 TheNewBob (Jedidia). MIT License. https://github.com/Jedidia/TediousTravel

Used for: the design and portions of the implementation of real travel
(`Assets/Scripts/Game/Mobile/MobileJourneyController.cs`, `MobileJourneyPilot.cs`,
`MobileJourneyWindow.cs`), reworked for touch and for this port's road routing.

## Daggerfall

The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall is copyright Bethesda Softworks. No game data is distributed
with this repository; players supply their own `arena2` folder.

## Bundled mods

Ten Daggerfall Unity mods by **Cliffworms** are built into iOS `.dfmod` bundles and published as a
mod pack alongside each release (and may ship inside the app), each switchable in the launcher's MODS window. All are MIT licensed (`Copyright (c) 2025
Cliffworms`); the licence text ships in the app at `StreamingAssets/Mods/Licenses/`. They are
fetched at the pinned commits by `tools/bundled-mods/fetch.py` and are not part of this
repository's history.

Every manifest is the author's own. The data in every bundle is Cliffworms' work, unmodified.

Not included, and why: **Detailed Main Quest Dungeons**, **Main Quest Consequences** and **Detailed
Dungeon Exteriors** reference texture archives and models from Daggerfall Expanded Textures and
Decor & Miscellanea, which we cannot redistribute; without them a block's flats throw during
layout and the whole dungeon fails to build (verified 2026-09-01). `tools/bundled-mods/fetch.py`
now rejects any block that references a non-vanilla texture archive or a required dependency the
pack does not ship.
